I\'ve been focusing on HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, ES6, React, Redux, Webpack, PostCSS, Node, Express, and MongoDB. I also have experience with Ruby, Rails, MySQL, PostreSQL, and PHP. I\'ve been helping out on projects with small businesses and startups and currently I\'m in the market for new opportunities.'}
