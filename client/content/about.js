  'I love languages, literature and philosophy. I studied classical langauges and literature as an undergraduate with a special interest in Greek and Indian philosophy and critical and cultural theory. I never mastered any one language but over the years studied bits and pieces of French, Spanish, Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Arabic and Thai. I also earned a CELTA certificate and taught English as a second langauge in Laos and Thailand.',

  'I love music and film. I played in a rock band when I was in highschool and I let myself get lost in loops and electric beats when I was in college. I worked on film and video projects throughout college including a series of live music performances and an experimental short film called "Aspectator". I also helped film a documentary called "Living on One Dollar", a short video called "Alleviating Poverty in Vietnam", and a short film called "Rosa - These Storms".'
